# IsoBattleSystem (WIP)
Isometric Battle System for EB, a work in progress scripting thing that aims to make EB's battle system more visual appealing by representing characters onto the battle field
Still in a WIP, TODOs:
* Make Paula, Jeff, and Poo have their own battle sprites appear and do similar things that Ness has implemented
* Get feedback on what to improve next and bugfix if needed

Special thanks to:
* Catador - Making the movscr_codes.ccs file, everything basically hinges on this script file for the main animations to work
* Cooprocks123e - Making movescr_memaccess.ccs file, needed for movement scripts for sprites to change animations
* Vittorio - ASM code for helping me to align sprites to certain layers to keep them not bouncing when players/enemies do SMAAAAASH-ing damage
* JTolmar - Writing the battle_menu.ccs file, I did not want to touch the battle menu routine and this makes it easier to intergrate the flags into it
* And anyone else that I haven't credit yet, please let me know if you had helped me. I am a forgetful (D-)man TwT
