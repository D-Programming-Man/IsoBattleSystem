Thanks to:                                                                         
* Catador
  - Making movscr_codes that's paramount to most Action/Movement Scripts     
* Cooprocks123e
  - Making Bowspr for adding sprites in battle, majority of this script requires both this and movscr_codes                                
* JTolmar
  - Making the battle_menu, I'd rather not edit the raw ASM for the battle menu so having this is very handy adding flags to it                     
* Vittorio
  - Knowledge and advice on how the heck to not make sprites keep on springing up and down when an enemy attacks.                            
* SupremeKribs
  - Advice on what routines to look after for enemy adjustments
