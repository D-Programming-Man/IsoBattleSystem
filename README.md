# BowsprBattleSystem
What this script does is to add your party's representation during battle. It has
support for animations to your party: idle, status affected, or special case 
attacks like prayer for Paula and mirror for Poo. Although, only the main 4 characters
are implemented, however it's not hard to make more for the other NPC characters.

  - Making the battle_menu, I'd rather not edit the raw ASM for the battle menu so having this is very handy adding flags to it
